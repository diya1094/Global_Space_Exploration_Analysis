**ðŸŒŒ Global Space Exploration Dataset Analysis**

Semester 6 Data Science Project

Welcome to my data science project analyzing trends, missions, and key insights from global space exploration activities. This repository contains the dataset, analysis scripts, visualizations, and a summary of findings.

**ðŸ“Š Project Overview**

Space exploration has evolved rapidly over the decades, involving multiple countries, private organizations, and technological breakthroughs. This project aims to:
- Explore trends in space missions globally.
- Analyze mission success rates by country and organization.
- Identify key players and emerging contributors in space exploration.

**ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools**
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings**

Some of the insights derived from this analysis include:

- Germany has the highest average success rate of 76.25%
- Higher budgets may not always lead to higher success rates.
- Mission type plays a role in cost and perhaps success.
- Some countries/collaborations tend to have more consistent or high-performing missions.
- Environmental impact and technology might be potential predictors in future models.
- Mission Type Success Rates
  - Manned Missions: ~75.23% success rate
  - Unmanned Missions: ~74.73% success rate
  -  Both types show nearly similar reliability.
